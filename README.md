### To run this program ###
cv2, numpy ,matplotlib, math library is required. Alternatively, you can use requirements.txt file for env setup.

Utils.py will have required functions that are used to extract wall.
Running main.py file will use functions of utils.py and save images of wall boundary.
And Visualisation of functions.ipynb will visualize the ouput of all intermediary functions to show what each function does.

Room1_wall.png , Room2_wall.png and Room3_wall.png are my solutions.
